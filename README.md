At the request of University of Pennsylvania instruction staff, I have changed the visibility of the following projects to "Private" in support of their academic integrity goals. 

Penn-Shell;
Penn-Shredder;
Penn-Shake;
Penn-Chord and Penn-Search

A ReadMe for each of these projects can be found in this repository.

Please email me if you are a recruiter/prospective employer and would like access to the full repositories for each project. Thanks!
