At the request of University of Pennsylvania instruction staff, I have changed the visibility of the following projects to "Private" in support of their academic integrity goals. 

Penn-Shell \n
Penn-Shredder \n
Penn-Chord and Penn-Search \n
\n
Please email me if you are a recruiter/prospective employer and would like access. Thanks!
